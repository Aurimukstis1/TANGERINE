TANGERINE - The simple, cool looking loader icon.

This is supposed to be fully modifiable.

You can change the screen height and width,
you can change rotational and size coefficients,
you can change the colors,
there's even a loading bar code you can modify to show up which could technically be linked somehow to a progress report while another program is intiliazing, let's say for example the UI has done initializing for another program, that can be sent to here to increment the loading bar and just quit the loading program itself.

to be honest, this whole loading spinning cube thing was a graphical screw-up, but it looked cool so I made it into a loading application.
